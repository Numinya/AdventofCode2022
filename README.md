# My Submissions
The above files are the problems that I was able to solve on my own. So far I am stuck on day 12. Some of the problems and comments I would like to highlight are listed here:
* Day 9 Rope Bridge Part 2
  - This problem was the most challenging one I did by far. 
  - Created neccessary objects and operator overloads
  - A bit of single linked list practise
  - Not a very intuitive solution
* Day 10 Cathode Ray Tube
  - Although this problem was relatively simple I thought the problem itself was very fun
* Day 11 Monkey Business Part 2
  - I want to highlight this one as I had to use an idea from my proofs class that I thought I'd never use
  - First time dealing with integer overflow
  - Chinese Remainder Theorem was used to deal with the problem of integer overflow
